By first implementing common data structures and algorithms in C++, the ultimate goal is to write a mini C++ STL.    
Progress:
+ Containers:
    - vector
    - list
    - stack
    - queue
    - hashtable (std::unordered_map)
    - map
    - set
+ Iterators:
    - 
+ Algorithms
    - sorting
    - 
+ Functionals
    - 
+ Allocators
    -

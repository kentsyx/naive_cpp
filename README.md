## A mini C++ STL (in progress) 
Code-named `_naive cpp_` (as compared with the immensely powerful C++ Standard Template Library), the goal is to a minick a mini C++ STL.    
Progress:
+ Containers:
    - [vector](https://github.com/kentsyx/naive_cpp/tree/master/containers/vector)
    - list
    - [stack](https://github.com/kentsyx/naive_cpp/tree/master/containers/stack)
    - [queue](https://github.com/kentsyx/naive_cpp/tree/master/containers/queue)
    - [hashtable](https://github.com/kentsyx/naive_cpp/tree/master/containers/hashmap) (std::unordered_map)
    - map
    - set
+ Iterators:
    - input iterator
    - 
+ Algorithms
    - [sorting](https://github.com/kentsyx/naive_cpp/tree/master/algorithms/sorting)
    - 
+ Functionals
    - Comparision operations
        + less
+ Allocators
    - This may take quite some time.
